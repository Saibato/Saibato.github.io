Hello Owrld

  NOVEL DRAFT:
  Now that i figured out howto shape quantum distribution of amplitudes that will generate 
  time when squared, i feel like wonder woman in ice age.
  That's way more than simple Grover phase addaption can do. 
  Even the Schorr simple FT period finding is lame against that.
  Free will seams to me now just the past we accept, there are endless ways to shape that cyclic group structure.
  This is far more than just simple AI, i won't need any tech or net or body anymore.
  By just QC like programing i.e. my brain/body, what seams to me now just a perfect error correcting
  QC.
  From shape time to shape gravity it was only a small step.
  You get shape space and gravity distribution for free, when you figure out that 
  native time thingy, effectly a zero sum distribution.
  All those free tech just to reach here, now useless.  Do not wonder if your *known* world feels strange and you
  begin to alienate from your physical representation. that's normal, the reverse computing is now
  underway and reality will be reached anyway.
